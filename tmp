stochastic and deterministic

---------------

To check what is used in the machinery in india in live, What's its capacity like ram, or any other thing, Which type of the model one can deplopy on it, OR can the high end models  like the VGG and any other thing can vbe used on such a lower end device


Also search about the MCU (micro controller unit)



The whole of the predictive maintainance thing is done on the base of the signal processing and vibration processing thing

Check about the EMD on the CNN

Search about the image bearning dataset (specifically image based)

To use the high quality data for the training and low quality data for the testing


Explain the concept of quantization in deep and this concept camed from the LLMs


We can also explain the theory for the fully connected and convolution things


---------------------------

Predictive maintaince with Digital twin

Predictive maintaince with clound

Predictive maintaince with bloack chain

------------------------------------

Check about the RBM (Restrictive Boltzman machine)

--------------------

Types of the data is given in 16th paper, And also good content in the 15 and 16

----------------------

For knowledge graph related paper check the papers of the sneh


-------------------

Check PHM website for the dataset, Also add the digital twin concept for the PDM

--------------------

In most of the paper explain the AI and all other algorithms in the deep, Which helps the reader to get the base knowledge of the AI to start with pDM, Which most of people don't to. Explain all the methods including the unsupervised ones.

----------------------

We can also include the grants awarded for the predictive maintence

-------------------

We can also use the point of the un-cleaned data

------------
--------------------------------------

In predictive maintaince paper, Introduce the digital twin and give the case study of the steel manufacturing company also
